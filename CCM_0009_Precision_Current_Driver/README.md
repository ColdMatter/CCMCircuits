# Precision Current Driver
     
This is a low-noise, low-current, bipolar-capable precision current supply.  Revision B onwards is modeled after Analog Devices application note AN-968.  Populate components as necessary to produce unipolar/bipolar operation with the desired input voltage to current scaling.
