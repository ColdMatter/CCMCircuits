# CCM_0021 Coil Protection
     
This circuit is designed to provide some level of protection for coils, particularly useful for those installed in vacuum where a melted coil represents a serious annoyance.  It features an adjustable soft current limit (by clamping a control voltage) and an adjustable hard energy limit (by opening an interlock and disabling the power supply).  The latter feature is obtained by integrating the dissipated power (roughly) and comparing to a setpoint.
