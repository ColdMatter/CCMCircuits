Changes for Sid's experiment (all configured for unipolar):

1) swapped control signal differential inputs to give positive current for positive control voltage

2) removed input parallel RC on both control-signal inputs, replaced R31 with 0 ohms to local-ground reference the control signal (otherwise was floating beyond common-mode limits of input op-amps).

3) R5 -> 0 ohms seemed to improve tunability of feedback

4) current sensor is "inverted", JP4 is installed

5) current monitor circuit is just wrong but even after making it a buffer the output signal is inverted
