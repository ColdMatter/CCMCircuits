Cryocooler Interlock and Heating
===========

This circuit acts as a control interface and safety interlock for the F50 cryocooler compressor and system heaters for our usual buffer-gas beam configuration of three heater channels.  Both manual or remote control options are available.  The circuit only allows the compressor to be activated if the external (NC) interlock is satisfied.  The initial build of the YbF "box" chamber uses hardware interlocks (in series) on the chamber pressure and temperature of the first and second cooler stages.  Heater control is completely independent of the interlock.  Activation of either the first or second stage (but not the SF6) heaters will disable the cryocooler.
