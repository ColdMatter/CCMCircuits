This is a simple analog output board useful for providing an adjustable voltage to a pzt amplifier, cavity, etc.  Jumpers allow the user to choose between unipolar and bipolar operation.  Substituting various LM-4040 (or equivalent) reference diodes allows the voltage ranges to be adjusted.  

Currently, everyone in the lab uses 9V batteries with old-school trimpots wired up to them for this type of application.  Unsurprisingly, nobody ever remembers to disconnect the battery when they are finished.  As a result, we have lots of dead 9V batteries in the lab.  I've remedied the problem temporarily with some rechargeable batteries, but the practice is still stupid.

It might be a better idea to do a multi-channel board that fits nicely in a NIM rack...
