50Hz Triangular wave generator

This circuit takes a 50Hz square wave and integrates it to turn  it into a triangular wave. 
The gain of the integrator is controlled via a trimpot and rotary switch. An external voltage offset
can also be added. This circuit is designed to drive the thorlabs cavities used in the transfer cavity
