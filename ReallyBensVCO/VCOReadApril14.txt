Buffered VCO. Any Minicircuits VCO will work.

Traces are nominally 50 Ohm of 1/16" FR4 circuit board.

The op-amp is optional, depending if you want a 
buffered summing configuration.

When building the board, I suggest placing the chokes
first (the TCCH80) since they are almost impossible to solder.
This makes it easy to check that they are connected and 
not shorted.
