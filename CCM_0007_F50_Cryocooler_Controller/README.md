Cryocooler Phase Lock
===========

This project is meant to allow us to phase lock our buffer-gas molecular beam experiments to the ~ 1 Hz cryocooler cooling cycle.  It accomplishes this placing a microphone close to the high-pressure helium lines and providing an output trigger based on when the volume exceeds some threshold.  The delay can be controlled with an analog input.
