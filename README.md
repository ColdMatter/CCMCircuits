CCMCircuits
===========

This is a repository for circuits used by the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College. Each project should be in its own directory, and should contain a .brd and a .sch file, an "about.txt" file which gives any useful information on the circuit. You can also upload files used to make the circuit in the PCB mill, and any measurements that you make of the circuit's behaviour. Please try not to upload all of the temporary files made by Eagle.
