Diode Stabilisation Circuit

This is a work in progress circuit which aims to stabilise a laser diode 
to the centre of its mode. It works by modulating the diode current and 
lock in detecting the increased intensity noise, then feeding back to the 
current to minimise this noise. This works in conjunction with a frequency
lock. It's a copy of the work in Chiow's paper:
