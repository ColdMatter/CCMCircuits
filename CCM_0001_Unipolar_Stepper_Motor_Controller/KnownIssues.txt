Known issues with RevA and planned changes for RevB:

-- HARDWARE:
-- Somehow I forgot a 10k pullup on the MCLR_ pin to 5V.  You'll need to add one manually in order for the PIC to run.
-- The USB connector is backwards with respect to the commercial cable, be careful you don't plug it in as is. 
-- For the next revision, it would be nice to control the Vref pin of the L297 driver from an analog output on the PIC (variable power).
