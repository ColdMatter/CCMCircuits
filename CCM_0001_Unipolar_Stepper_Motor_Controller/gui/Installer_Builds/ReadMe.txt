There are two types of installers.  The "Full" installer includes the Labview Runtime Engine and VISA drivers, in addition to the stepper motor executable and ftdi drivers.  The "Partial" only includes the stepper motor executable and ftdi drivers.  

Note that you may not be able to run this installer from deep within the directory tree.  If you get an error saying "the installer cannot find the file specified", odds are that your paths are too long.  Try running from the desktop instead.
